# Promises Practice

## 🎮 About the Project
This project demonstrates the use of multiple promises with different behaviors:
- **firstPromise**: 
  - Resolves with a message "First promise was resolved" when the user clicks on the left side of the document.
  - Rejects with a message "First promise was rejected" after 3 seconds if no click happens.
- **secondPromise**: Resolves with a message "Second promise was resolved" when either left or right click is detected. This promise never rejects.
- **thirdPromise**: Resolves with a message "Third promise was resolved" only after both left and right clicks occur.
